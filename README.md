# Occurrence data architecture and uncertainty-driven exposure

This repository contains scripts and supporting material associated with a research manuscript examining how **structural properties of occurrence data architectures** shape uncertainty in dietary exposure assessment.

The focus of the work is on **data architecture and propagation**, not on re-estimating exposure or comparing contaminants toxicologically.

## Repository purpose

The purpose of this repository is to ensure **analytical traceability and reproducibility** for all data transformations, diagnostics and figures used in the manuscript.

Scripts are designed to:
- ingest publicly available regulatory datasets,
- compute architecture-level diagnostics (e.g. censoring, aggregation effects),
- generate figures and tables directly supporting the manuscript.

This repository does not aim to provide a general-purpose exposure modelling framework.

## Scope of the analysis

The analysis focuses on a limited number of case studies selected to span **distinct monitoring architectures and governance contexts** within food systems.  
Details on the rationale for case selection and conceptual framing are documented internally and will be reflected in the manuscript.

Only data and analyses that directly contribute to the final paper are included.
